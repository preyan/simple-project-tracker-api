# Simple Project Tracker API

**Express Server with MongoDB**
This is a simple Express server that uses MongoDB as a database. It exposes a few RESTful APIs for managing users, projects, and tasks. This project uses `pnpm` as the default package manager.

**Getting Started**
To get started, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```javascript
 pnpm add express mongoose cors dotenv cookie-parser
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the server by running the following command:

```javascript
 pnpm node server
```

The server will listen on port 3500 by default. You can access the APIs at the following URLs:

- `/users`
- `/projects`
- `/tasks`

## Documentation

The full documentation for the APIs will be available soon.

## Testing

The server comes with a built-in test suite. To run the tests, you can run the following command:

```javascript
 pnpm run test
```
